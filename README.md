Terraria's Dedicated Server Mod
-------------

Aims to provide a stable Server + API which is compatible with Mono.

If you like TDSM or want to help support us, we simply ask you to tell your friends about it, and help spread the word!.

* Jump on over to the Forums at: http://www.tdsm.org/
* Dev's are more than welcome to post their commits to my page, I'm all for it. 


TDSM IS NOT tMod. TDSM was actually under development before tMod was released.

-	TDSM has been tested on a Ubuntu System with the Latest Mono installed. It was proven to be working! All you need to do is set debugmode to True in the server properties


Status
-------------
TDSM is currently runnable as a server, You may also find that Developers can also now make plugins for it if they feel so.

How To Use
-------------
To use TDSM place the executable in the location you wish, Then run it. It will generate a properties file & start generating a world!
This properties file contains server properties such as Max Players, Greeting (MOTD) and the port to use.

TDSM has included the use for Operators. To use this feature simply set a password in the server properties and when you log into the server, enter your password and you will be given OP status. This allows you to use commands such as /exit & /reload etc.

TODO
-------------
* Yet to clean up (Minor)
* Yet to removed un-needed code for client purpose. (Major)
* Yet to test on other OS's
* Yet to add more plugin hooks! (Possibly wanting to organise current Events)
* Yet to rememeber what else!

Developers
=============
TDSM is developed in C# so you will find it reasonably easy to manipulate. Also if ever have done Bukkit (Minecraft) Programming you should see some things are similar when programming a plugin.
Plugins HAVE to be developed on the .Net 3.5 framework (In Visual Studio you have multiple choices, Choose 3.5) otherwise TDSM will not be able to load your plugin!.
When developing a Plugin it is no longer needed for the Namespace & Class to be the same, It is now Dynamic.

On a side note, 
I would love for you to assist in the Development TDSM, you may fully well do so; It's why there is a GitHub :D
